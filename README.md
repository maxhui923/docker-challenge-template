# Learning Outcomes for Docker Challenges

## Challenge 1 - Simple web server for static web pages
- Basics of Docker: Understand how to use Docker to create and manage containers.
- Docker Image Creation: Learn how to build a Docker image using a Dockerfile.
- Container Deployment: Deploy a Docker container and access the served content through a browser.
- Version Control with Git and GitHub: Use Git and GitHub to manage code versions and collaborate with others.
- Documentation and Reporting: Write a comprehensive report documenting the steps taken, including screenshots and explanations.

## Challenge 2 - Creating a dynamic application
- Docker Compose: Introduce the concept of Docker Compose for orchestrating multiple containers.
- Containerization of NodeJS Application: Dockerize a NodeJS application using a Dockerfile.
- Service Orchestration: Use Docker Compose to define and manage multiple services (e.g., NGinx, API server).
- Testing and Troubleshooting: Verify that all services are running correctly and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
- Submission and Documentation: Submit the project repository's URL and provide a detailed report on the steps taken, including screenshots and explanations.

## Challenge 3 - Full stack application
- Service Connection and Integration: Understand how different components (services) in a full-stack application connect and work together.
- Environment Variables: Learn how to manage and use environment variables in application configurations.
- Docker Compose: Gain proficiency in writing a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate multiple services (web server, application, and database) simultaneously.
- Database Integration: Integrate a database (MySQL/MariaDB) into the application stack and ensure proper communication between the application and the database.
- Testing and Validation: Verify that all services are running correctly and that the application responds as expected when accessed through a browser.
- Documentation and Reporting: Produce a detailed report documenting the configuration variables, steps taken, and outcomes achieved. Include screenshots and explanations in your documentation.

## Challenge 4 - Scaling up an application
- Service Scaling: Learn how to scale a service by increasing the number of instances running simultaneously.
- Load Balancing: Understand the benefits of scaling an application by having multiple instances running instead of just one, including load distribution and redundancy.
- Research and Implementation: Conduct research on scaling Docker services and apply the learned concepts to scale the node-service from 1 to 3 instances.
- Testing and Validation: Perform GET requests to the application to observe the effects of scaling on the application's behavior, particularly in terms of hostname variation due to load balancing.
- Documentation and Reporting: Document the steps taken to scale the service, record the observed changes in application behavior, and provide evidence through screenshots and command outputs.
